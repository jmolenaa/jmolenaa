I'm Jan Molenaar, a student at Codam Coding College in Amsterdam, which is part of the 42 network.\
Currently I am following the curriculum which involves coding in C and C++.\
All the projects I finish during this course are available in repositories on this page.

<!---
jmolenaa/jmolenaa is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
