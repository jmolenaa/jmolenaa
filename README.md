I'm Jan Molenaar a student at Codam Coding College in Amsterdam, which is part of the 42 network.
Currently I am following the curriculum which involves coding in C and C++, server managamenent and other computer science concepts.
All the projects I finish during this course are available in repositories on this page.
This means that right now I'm only comfortable with C as a programming language, but whenever I participate in a coding event I'd like to take the opportunity to learn a new language.
