#### I'm Jan Molenaar, a student at Codam Coding College in Amsterdam, which is part of the 42 network.  
##### Currently I am following the core curriculum which involves coding in C and C++.  
##### All the projects I finish during this course are available in repositories on this [page](https://github.com/jmolenaa/jmolenaa_Codam).
